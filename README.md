This repository contains my solutions to the 2 Capstone projects in Jose Portilla's Udemy  course on Data Analysis and Visualization.
You can find it here: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/

The first dataset is of 911 calls in USA.
The second dataset uses Yahoo's finance API to get stock data of 6 major banks in USA from 2006 to 2016.

Tools used: Python language with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly(super-fun).

pip install all the libraries to check out the plots and data-stuff.
